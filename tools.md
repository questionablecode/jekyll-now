This page details the tools and general setup used for software audits of Android applications.  At the core resides a program analysis platform called [Atlas](https://www.ensoftcorp.com/atlas/).  At this time the version of Atlas used to audit Android APKs is a beta release of Atlas for Jimple, which allows analysis of Java bytecode.  On top of Atlas, is a custom open source "toolbox" containing utilities for auditing software.  More details coming soon.
